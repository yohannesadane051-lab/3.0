    "question": "A 39-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to mild shortness of breath and right-sided pleuritic chest pain that began this morning. The patient underwent a mastectomy for left-sided breast cancer 2 weeks ago. She has a history of hives after eating seafood. Blood pressure is 148/96 mm Hg, pulse is 114/min, and respirations are 21/min. Oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Chest x-ray is unremarkable and urine pregnancy test is negative. Creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic approach?",
    "options": [
      "A. CT pulmonary angiography after pretreatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines",

      "E. Ventilation-perfusion scan"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, chest pain, and hypoxia, along with a history of breast cancer, is highly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) using intravenous, usually iodinated radiocontrast, is the first-choice imaging test for diagnosing acute PE. The exact mechanism of radiocontrast-induced anaphylaxis is not known. However, the widely held notion that seafood allergy increases the risk of anaphylaxis to iodinated contrast has no basis in medical literature. Therefore, patients with seafood allergy can receive iodinated contrast and do not require pretreatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines (Choice A). The converse is also true—patients who have had anaphylaxis due to iodinated contrast do not need to avoid seafood. (Choice B) High-osmolar radiocontrast is associated with increased rates of allergic reaction and contrast-induced nephropathy. Therefore, low- or iso-osmolar radiocontrast is used in most settings regardless of allergy history. (Choice D) Compression ultrasonography can diagnose deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and suggest the presence of PE. However, the absence of DVT does not rule out PE. CTPA is more diagnostically definitive and is the preferred study in patients without contraindication. (Choice E) Ventilation-perfusion scanning may be used in evaluation of PE in patients with a contraindication to CTPA (eg, renal insufficiency, true contrast allergy) or in those with an inconclusive CTPA. It is also the initial test of choice for pregnant patients with suspected PE and a normal chest x-ray.",

He has no medical problems, takes no medications, and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. There is no history of trauma to the abdomen. He does not have dry eyes or dry mouth. On admission, ultrasound of the abdomen shows no gallstones. CT of the abdomen reveals a 3x4-cm solid mass in the mid-portion of his pancreas with some surrounding edema. Chest CT reveals bilateral hilar adenopathy. He is started on intravenous fluids, opioids for pain control, and nothing by mouth, and his abdominal pain resolves. On examination, he is well-nourished and appears comfortable. His blood pressure is 133/78 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation of acute idiopathic pancreatitis, bilateral salivary and lacrimal gland enlargement, and lymphadenopathy suggests immunoglobulin IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a fibro-inflammatory disease causing fibrosis and tumor-like swelling of affected organs. IgG4-RD is an emerging disease of unknown etiology. It most commonly affects middle-aged men and should be suspected in patients presenting with any of the following: Idiopathic pancreatitis, Sclerosing cholangitis, Bilateral salivary and/or lacrimal gland enlargement. Up to 40% of patients may have peripheral eosinophilia. Diagnosis is confirmed with tissue biopsy showing IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes. Elevated serum IgG4 can be helpful as well although serum levels can be normal. Patients typically respond to glucocorticoids. (Choice B) Patients with lymphoma can present with a pancreatic mass and lymphadenopathy, but they often present with B symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats) as well. This patient's presentation of acute pancreatitis and bilateral parotid and lacrimal gland swelling is not typical for lymphoma. (Choice C) Alcoholism is sometimes associated with parotid gland enlargement in malnourished patients. Alcoholism sufficient to cause acute pancreatitis is often associated with increased mean corpuscular volume and elevated transaminases. This patient has none of these features and denies alcohol use. (Choice D) Autoimmune pancreatitis is a prototypical form of IgG4-RD that can mimic pancreatic cancer with a pancreatic mass and painless jaundice. However, there is usually no history of weight loss. (Choice E) Patients with Sjögren's syndrome usually complain of dry mouth and eyes, and/or arthralgia. They also have antibodies to SSA and SSB proteins and do not have recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, as is common in IgG4-RD. Patients with IgG4-related salivary and lacrimal gland disease do not have severe sicca symptoms despite glandular enlargement.",

      "E. Washed red cells"
    ],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "When red cells and plasma are separated from whole blood, small amounts of residual plasma remain in the red cell concentrate. This plasma contains proteins, including IgA. IgA deficient patients develop antibodies against IgA, which can react with IgA-containing donor products and induce an anaphylactic reaction. To reduce this risk, red cells should be washed to remove as much of the plasma as possible. (Choices B & C) Packed red cells can also be contaminated with leukocytes or leukocyte debris during the separation process. This can induce febrile transfusion reactions and HLA alloimmunization. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) also resides in the leukocytes and can be transmitted through transfusion. Thus, leukoreduction with filters to remove WBCs reduces the risk of HLA alloimmunization, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, and transmission of CMV. However, leukoreduction alone cannot remove all lymphocyte components. But, gamma radiation can essentially kill all the living lymphocytic components (T-lymphocytes). This is particularly useful in patients at risk for transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, a rare, but fatal complication caused by the engraftment and proliferation of donor T lymphocytes in the transfused recipient. (Choice A) Desensitization to HLA and ABO antigens is indicated for certain patients who are difficult to transfuse secondary to their broad immunogenicity.",

      "E. Serum tryptase levels"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Hymenoptera stings can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis. One study found that up to 50% of patients with anaphylaxis had no previous reaction or known allergy. Sixty percent of adult subjects with a history of anaphylaxis from a previous sting will have anaphylaxis with a repeat sting. Venom immunotherapy (VIT) reduces this risk to less than 5% by producing venom-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G, changing T cell responses, and decreasing venom-specific IgE. VIT is indicated in patients with a history of systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting and evidence of venom-specific IgE, either by skin or in vitro test. Discharge care should also include education on avoidance and an epinephrine autoinjector. (Choices A and B) Acute medical treatment for anaphylaxis includes intramuscular epinephrine, H-1 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and supportive therapy for shock. However, these agents are not as beneficial after resolution of the acute episode. (Choice D) Serum IgE levels rise during the acute anaphylaxis stage and during the first few months of immunotherapy before decreasing over the next 3-5 years of VIT. However, these levels do not reliably predict protection from future anaphylaxis reactions. (Choice E) Tryptase is a mediator released from mast cells and basophils. Serum tryptase levels may be elevated in anaphylaxis but also in other mast cell disorders (eg, systemic mastocytosis) and myelodysplastic syndromes. In addition, tryptase decreases after the anaphylaxis reaction and would not be as useful to monitor as immunotherapy in this patient.",

She often has paroxysms of 10-12 sneezes, especially when waking up in the morning. She also complains of chronic rhinorrhea and post-nasal drip, and she occasionally has itchy eyes. She is unsure if there is a seasonal component to her symptoms, but they may be worse in the Spring. She has tried chlorpheniramine in the past, but it made her drowsy. She does not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol and she denies cocaine or other illicit drug use. She has mild hypertension but is in good health otherwise. Her blood pressure is 134/84 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. Her nares are patent with a clear discharge. There are no nasal polyps or septal deviation. The turbinates are pale and her conjunctivae appear normal. Neck, pulmonary, and cardiovascular examinations are within normal limits.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation is consistent with typical allergic rhinitis, which affects a large percentage of the normal population. For many individuals, the symptoms are disturbing; they can lower quality of life and impair sleep. Patients typically present with sneezing, watery nasal discharge, and pale turbinates. Although most patients have seasonal exacerbations, this is not always the case. Clinical history and examination are sufficient to establish a diagnosis, and skin testing or other tests to detect allergens are not necessary at this time. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that nasal corticosteroids are superior to all other listed modalities in relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. (Choice A) Leukotriene antagonists may be of some benefit, but they are not as effective as nasal corticosteroids. (Choice C) Nasal decongestants are effective for short-term relief of symptoms but should be avoided due to desensitization and rebound symptoms, which can lead to overuse and rhinitis medicamentosa. (Choice D) Oral decongestants can be effective for short periods to decrease rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, but they have no impact on sneezing and itching eyes. In addition, they can increase blood pressure. (Choice E) Sedating and non-sedating anti-histamines often relieve symptoms and are commonly used in patients with paroxysmal and mild symptoms. However, they are inferior to nasal steroids in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe symptoms (such as this patient).",

      "E. Primary ciliary dyskinesia"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This patient's vitiligo, recurrent sinusitis, and previous history of pneumonia suggest likely common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is the most common immunodeficiency disorder affecting children and young adults and is due to impaired B cell differentiation and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and/or IgM) production. Patients typically present before age 20 (delayed diagnosis is common) with variable clinical manifestations such as infections (eg, rhinosinusitis and pneumonia) and chronic lung disease. Nearly 75% of patients have a history of pneumonia that is usually due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma, or Haemophilus influenzae. Diagnosis is suggested by low immunoglobulin levels, poor response to vaccinations, and exclusion of other disorders. Treatment includes antibiotics for specific infections and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Immunoglobulin therapy can improve CVID prognosis by reducing the number of infections and hospitalizations, reducing antibiotic use, and possibly decreasing progression of chronic lung disease. CVID patients are more likely to develop malignancies and require age-appropriate cancer screening, monitoring for lymphoma, or possible bronchoscopy for unresolved pulmonary findings despite treatment. Chronic lung disease and malignancies are the most common causes of death. (Choice B) Adult cystic fibrosis generally presents with a milder form of the disease that consists of mild respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disease (eg, recurrent pancreatitis, biliary cirrhosis, and portal hypertension), or abnormal reproductive function. This patient's absence of a long history of lung infections or gastrointestinal or fertility problems makes this less likely. (Choice C) Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) typically present with pulmonary and renal disease, history of oronasal ulcers, and persistent rhinorrhea (leading to bony destruction and 'saddle-nose' deformity). In addition, the urinalysis is usually abnormal (eg, hematuria and non-nephrotic-range proteinuria). (Choice D) Patients with myeloperoxidase deficiency may be asymptomatic or present with recurrent Candida infections (mucocutaneous, meningeal, osteomyelitis, and sepsis). However, this patient has no prior history of Candida infections. (Choice E) Primary ciliary dyskinesia typically presents with nasal polyposis, otitis, recurrent respiratory infections, situs inversus (present in 50% of patients), and infertility. This patient is not infertile, which makes primary ciliary dyskinesia less likely.",

    "explanation": "Specificity, sometimes called the true negative rate, is the proportion of patients who have a negative test result among all those who truly do not have the disease of interest. The formula to calculate specificity is TN/(TN+FP) where TN denotes true negatives (ie, patients who test negative and do not have the disease) and FP denotes false positives (ie, patients who test positive but do not have the disease). The sum (TN+FP) represents all patients who do not have the disease of interest (negative condition). According to the table, 85 patients did not have myocardial scar tissue (ie, negative condition) given that they recovered their myocardial contractility following surgery. Out of these 85 patients, 82 (ie, TN) were correctly identified by delayed gadolinium enhancement on MRI (ie, negative test result in a patient without the condition). This means that the specificity of MRI was 82/85=96.5% when used to assess scar tissue. Out of these 85 patients, 3 had a positive test result even though they did not have scar tissue; these represent false positives.  (Choice B) The calculation 92/100=92% gives the sensitivity of the test. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives (TP) among all those who have the disease.  (Choice C) The calculation 92/95=97% gives the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test. The PPV is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives.
